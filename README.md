# data-cave
Welcome to my data-cave, an ever expanding page with random projects, R and Python scripts and other data-science related stuff I'm spending my time on.

Some basic RShiny apps I played around with:

Central Limit Theorem demonstration: https://odlerm.shinyapps.io/CentralLimitTheorem/

Perceptron: https://odlerm.shinyapps.io/perceptron/

Slovakia Ag Covid testing by districts: https://odlerm.shinyapps.io/SVK_Covid_testing/
